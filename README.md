# Description:

The Time Log App is a modern, client-side web application built using React and Redux. It allows users to log their time entries, filter them by month and time range, and manage their logs with ease. The app leverages Redux for state management and localStorage for data persistence across sessions.

The app features a dynamic form for adding time logs, with fields like start time, end time, description, and activity type. It also supports editing and deleting entries, allowing users to manage their time efficiently.



# Key Features:

1). Time Logging: Users can log activities by specifying a start time, end time, and description.

2). State Management with Redux: State is managed using Redux, allowing for easy updates and synchronization across the app.

3). Filtering by Month/Time: Users can filter logs by selecting a specific month or time range to narrow down the view.

4). Local Storage Integration: The app saves time log data in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.

5). Editable and Deletable Entries: Users can edit or delete previously logged entries.

6) .Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works across different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).



# Technologies Used:

React.js: JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Redux: State management library for managing and centralizing app state.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the app with modern designs.

localStorage: Used to persist time logs in the browser so they are available even after page reloads.
